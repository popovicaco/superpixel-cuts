In hyperspectral imaging applications, there is emphasis on estimating the relative abundance of a given representantive material, called an endmember, within each pixel.  Unmixing results often give more detailed information about the overall composition of a hyperspectral scene with set of selected endmembers. This section will introduce the foundational knowledge behind unmixing and abundance estimation.
