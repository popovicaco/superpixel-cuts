In hyperspectral imaging applications, there is emphasis on estimating the relative abundance of a given representantive materical, called an endmember, within each pixel. 

Unmixing results often give more detailed information about the overall composition of a hyperspectral scene with respect to simple segmentation. This section will introduce the foundational framework behind unmixing and abundance estimation.
