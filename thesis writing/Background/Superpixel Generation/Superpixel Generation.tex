As mentioned in Section (2.1), high spectral resolution is a both and advantage and a challenge in hyperspectral image analysis, which causes the time complexity of certain algorithms to scale polynomially with the number of pixels in the image. 

Before the introduction of neural network based solutions in computer vision applications, there was interest in preclustering images into locally homogeneous regions called superpixels (\cite{SLIC}). Addressing the main motivation of reducing the overall granularity of the data, superpixels are also shown to preserve spectral information, adhere to spatial features in the image, and introduce robustness against noise in subsequent analysis tasks.
