abstract = {In June 2018, the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission was launched to measure plant temperatures and better understand how they respond to stress. While the ECOSTRESS mission delivers imagery with ~60 m spatial resolution, it is often useful to have spectra at the leaf level in order to explain variability seen at the pixel level. As it was originally titled, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spectral library version 2.0 has been expanded to support ECOSTRESS studies by including major additions of laboratory measured vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) spectra. The library now contains 541 leaf visible shortwave infrared (VIS/SWIR) spectra, 472 leaf thermal infrared (TIR) spectra, and 51 NPV VIS/SWIR and TIR spectra. Previously, the library primarily contained VSWIR and TIR laboratory spectra of minerals, rocks, and man-made materials. This new library, containing over 3000 spectra, was renamed the ECOSTRESS spectral library version 1.0 and is publicly available (http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov). It should be noted that as with the prior versions of the library, the VSWIR and TIR measurements were made with separate instruments with different calibration sources. Care should be taken when combining the data into a seamless spectrum to cover the entire spectral range. The ECOSTRESS spectral library provides a comprehensive collection of natural and man-made laboratory collected spectra covering the wavelength range of 0.35–15.4 μm.}
