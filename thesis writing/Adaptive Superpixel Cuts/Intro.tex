This section focuses on introducing the proposed unsupervised hyperspectral image segmentation algorithm Adaptive Superpixel Cuts for Hyperspectral Images (ASC-HSI). This algorithm leverages the algorithms proposed in Section \ref{Background} to perform image segmentation on a superpixel-basis rather than a pixel-basis, reducing computational and memory costs while allowing for the use of a graph based approach to segmentation and unmixing. The steps of the algorithm can depicted as follows:
