This section focuses on introducing the proposed unsupervised hyperspectral image segmentation algorithm Adaptive Superpixel Cuts for Hyperspectral Images (ASC-HSI). This algorithm leverages the algorithms proposed in Section \ref{Background} to perform image segmentation on a superpixel-basis rather than a pixel-basis, reducing computational and memory costs while allowing for the use of a graph based approach to segmentation and unmixing. The steps of the algorithm can depicted as follows:

% Current methods for [task] often rely on [existing approach] but suffer from limitations like [limitation 1] and [limitation 2]. To address these challenges, we propose the [Name of your algorithm] algorithm. This algorithm leverages [core idea] to achieve [potential benefit]. We will detail the algorithm's inner workings and evaluate its performance in the following sections.
