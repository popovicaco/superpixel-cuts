Having presented the details of the proposed approach, this section aims to document the experimental evaluation of its performance with respect to well studied hyperpsectral datasets in the remote sensing field. Additionally, comparison in results is made to two popular segmentation algorithms. This section will demonstrate the ability of our method to acheive accurate segmentation, with a focus on its advantages in handling mixed pixels and spatially seperated materials.

% All experiements were performed on an 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS with 32GB of 4800MHz RAM. The implementation of the algorithm was done in Python 3.11 using the numpy and scipy libraries.
