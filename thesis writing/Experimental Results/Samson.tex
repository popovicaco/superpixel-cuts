Our proposed segmentation algorithm was applied to the Samson A,B and C datasets. While this dataset does not have ground truth labels provided, a qualitative comparison can be performed, with particular focus on noting the ability of the algorithm to distinguish highly mixed pixels along the shorelines of the image and the ability to capture spatial complex segments.

For the Samson datasets, prior knowledge about the scene confirms the aim is to segment the image into $n_e = 3$ segments corresponding to the Water, Dirt and Tree classes. Using an initial selection of $n_s = 961$ superpixels with shape parameter $m=3$ and unmixing parameters $\mu = 1$ and $\beta = 0.005$, a grid search was applied to $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ such that $\sigma \in [0.1, 0.001]$ and $\kappa \in [15, 40]$, to which $\sigma = 0.015$ and $\kappa = 30$ produced the most optimal results in terms of visual coherence with respect to the original image.

It can be seen that the algorithm performs well and creates segmentations analogous to the distribution of materials within the scene, with the additional benefit of being able to form noncontinuous structures when the spatial limit $\kappa$ is set to be higher, allowing more refined segmentation when pockets of materials exist within each other.
